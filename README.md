# VectorShift Take Home to show I know how to code at least

Hey what's up this is just something I whipped up in 30 minutes to show I some level of competency and I'm not going into all of this blind. I also made a friction log to get a better sense of the companies product here: https://mustafa-tariqk.github.io/jekyll/update/2024/05/11/Friction-Log-VectorShift.html

pip install from requirements.txt, run the vectorshift.py file, then the tests.py file, mess around with it. all that fun jazz
